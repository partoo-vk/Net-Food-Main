Net Food is a simple application in which users can further expand on their recipe inquiries.

In the first view users will simply enter a query. Net Food will take that search query and move to the next view.

In the second view users will be presented potential ingredients known to coexist with the ingredients proposed in the initial query.
When an ingredient is clicked on, it will be added to their original search query. The new query will repeat the cycle in finding new 
ingredients that coexist with the ones in the modified query. Once the user is satisfied with their refined query, they can click search 
to enter the third view.

In the third view users will be presented matching recipes containing all ingredients in their search query. Each recipe entry includes:
cooking time, an image, a rating, and a link to the recipe page. When a user clicks on a recipe they will exit our site.

Through this system users can utilize vague search entries with suggestions to discover new recipes to cook.
